Numeric Broadcast Protocol (NBP) Devices

TrackAddict can receive additional data channels from compatible devices that broadcast data via Numeric Broadcast Protocol (NBP). This is a simple universal format for devices to easily broadcast data to apps. See also: NBP Developer Information.
At the present time, only the Android version of the app supports this, and the device must use a conventional Bluetooth serial connection (SPP).
